At the beginning of each year, ITProTV has a company wide meeting wher we primarily set different goals for the different teams and announce them company wide. The result is that each team analyzes it's part and ultimately each team member sets his or her own goals. It is here I started to ask: "Are goals enough?"

I was reminded about goals needing to be SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Assignable, Realistic and Time-based--I know people have changed these over time). But the more I thought about those, the line between goals and outcomes became blurred again.  It was here though that I found something that was akin to what was bothering me about these concepts.

Next, I began to think in terms of “why?” George T. Doran who wrote the defining article on SMART goals helped when I read:
>“Notice that these criteria don't say that all objectives must be quantified on all levels of management. In certain situations it is not realistic to attempt quantification, particularly in staff middle-management positions. Practicing managers and corporations can lose the benefit of a more abstract objective in order to gain quantification. It is the combination of the objective and its action plan that is really important. Therefore serious management should focus on these twins and not just the objective.”
It was this statement that helped to clarify for me not only a distinction between goals and outcomes but also the “why it matters?” 

This paragraph helped to me to understand that SMART goals are about quantification (metrics) and outcomes are the “more abstract objective.”  But what is this idea of the more abstract objective?  It cannot be just a mere difference in syntax of goals and outcomes.  If there is a difference it must be at this substantive level of quantification in the same way that George T. Doran stated.  How do make the differentiation without relying subtile shade of meaning of the same words.
