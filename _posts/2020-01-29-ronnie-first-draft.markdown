Hello, this is my first post and first website. I've chosen to create a static generated site using Jekyll and pages.github.com.  This was more challenging thatI thought so I needed some help and want to give shoutout to Justin Dennison for his help when I finally installed Jekyll and then said: "now what?".

Why a website?  Well I wanted to see if I could do it and thought about it as a way to catalog thoughts and anything I find interesting.  I'm a tech guy and have been teaching IT for many years but I have thoughts that I thought would be good to make sure that I had a place to store them.

How I am I attempting to do to this?  I'm learning and my goal is to use just the terminal to do so...yes completely in the terminal. So there may come a time I don't know if it can be done...but I'll have help along the day to let me if I can do it or not.

So, I'll share more soon. ~ronnie
