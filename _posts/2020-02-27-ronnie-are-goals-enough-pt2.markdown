You want your people focused on outcomes instead of goals. Remember this is the "abstract objective" called out by Doran. Unlike the way I described SMART goals in which every element is quantifiable, outcomes are not. Rather than quantifiable, outcomes are desirable objectives and motivating to the individual, why? 
Essentially, outcomes are what we really desire to happen after we hit our goals.  They are the lasting positive results that are useful to that person and ultimately make that person more valuable to the team and company they're apart. So, we should focus more on outcomes, than goals. If we want to help people to thrive in what they do, we should help define outcomes clearly.

So, I came up with an acronym that I believe will help.  Outcomes should be HEARD. What do I mean by that?
* (H)elpful -- results that I find useful to myself or others. Let me give you an example.  I can earn a certification like the CCNA (goal) but what I really want is the knowledge behind that achievement that make's me a better networking professional.
* (E)nduring -- When I focus on the goal as an end result, I find the knowledge enough for the goal quickly fades once I've achieved my goal. An outcome should be where the value and knowledge doesn't disappear as quickly. It is the difference in reading for meaning versus reading something to say you read it.  One will impact you, the other will not.
* (A)ccesible -- I work with a bunch of smart people. I'm always in awe that my teammates can pull the knowledge out of their head when needed.  This is an outcome that we should strive for rather than a short term goal where I forgot it a soon as I got to my goal.
* (R)eliable -- The outcome should be reliable.  That means that it's not only good for a day but valid until proven wrong, if ever proven wrong.  
* (D)emonstrable -- An outcome should help me to be demonstrable.  It's not about proving how smart you are. It's more about can you do it called upon to do it?

Take the time with your teams to define the outcomes you want to achieve in as much detail as time will allow. This will not be wasted time. Doing this, your team will hit their goals. They will focus the efforts based on results they already desire achieve and are motivated to doing it.
