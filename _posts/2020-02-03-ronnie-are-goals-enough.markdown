2020 is now a month old. Many people, groups, teams, departments, companies probably began talking about goals for 2020 near the end of 2019 but may not have actually set anything concrete until this past month. Individuals make resolutions; business make goals. I’ll not put my New Years resolutions out for you to mock and laugh at me. I will though speak about a great thing we do at ITProTV. We had a company meeting in that meeting we set out a theme for this year. This sets goals we want to achieve through an easy and fun way. I know this isn’t unique to just our company.

But this year as we spoke of goals, I started to think about a question: “Are goals enough?” I was thinking, “is there anything we should be doing beside goals?” To my surprise, it was almost answered immediately. We started to talk about goals and outcomes.  As I listened to different team leaders talk about them, I realized that I wasn’t sure I actually understood the difference or could even articulate what the differences are between them. The line blurred as reports were presented. It’s not the fault of the presenters as much as maybe it was my attention and my focus. But I realized that we needed to understand them both.

So later that week, it kept creeping into my mind so I decided to define them and then trying to formulate how to make the differentiation clear for myself as well as my team. After looking at definitions…I realized it’s wasn’t a definition I was after.

I was reminded about goals needing to be SMART goals (Specific, Measurable, Assignable, Realistic and Time-based--I know people have changed these over time). But the more I thought about those, the line between goals and outcomes became blurred again.  It was here though that I found something that was akin to what was bothering me about these concepts.

Next, I began to think in terms of “why?” George T. Doran who wrote the defining article on SMART goals helped when I read:
>“Notice that these criteria don't say that all objectives must be quantified on all levels of management. In certain situations it is not realistic to attempt quantification, particularly in staff middle-management positions. Practicing managers and corporations can lose the benefit of a more abstract objective in order to gain quantification. It is the combination of the objective and its action plan that is really important. Therefore serious management should focus on these twins and not just the objective.”
It was this statement that helped to clarify for me not only a distinction between goals and outcomes but also the “why it matters?” 

This paragraph helped to me to understand that SMART goals are about quantification (metrics) and outcomes are the “more abstract objective.”  But what is this idea of the more abstract objective?  It cannot be just a mere difference in syntax of goals and outcomes.  If there is a difference it must be at this substantive level of quantification in the same way that George T. Doran stated.  How do make the differentiation without relying subtile shade of meaning of the same words.
