Many people have been pushing hard by studying and preparing for the current CCNA and CCNP exams because the last day of testing is 23 February 2020. To those that have near the finishing line. Keep Going! You still have about 2.5 weeks for serious hard study.  You need a plan more than just reading now. So what should we be doing. Here's 6 things to do with the pressure on your shoulders.

* If you haven't registered for your exam. Remember everyone is under the deadline. So if you take the exam in a heavily populated area, remember exam seat availability should not be the thing that keeps you from getting your CCNA or CCNP. Do it now!

* Make sure you're doing subnetting every day. Work on different scenarios that you believe you can be tested on subnetting, including binary, CIDR notation, subnet mask, wildcard masks, hosts per network, number of networks...etc.

* Each study session should include 1 hard topic and 2 for review.  If you do multiple sessions a day fine. Do it but use this pattern: Review topic, Hard Topic, Review topic. Start with a nice review to get your mind ready to work (10-20min), Dive hard into your hard topic(1hr+) then end your session with another review (10-20min). Let's be real right now. With only 3 weeks, left there shouldn't be many topics that are left outside of your comfort zone. 

* Go ahead and write out all your hardest topics left. Stop reading and "do it, Do it NAAAWWH!" Once you do, arrange them 1 per study session. If you're not sure, print out the exam topic blueprint from Cisco.  Put a '+' for a review topic and an '*' for hard topic. If you have more hard topics that days left before the exam...You may need help--ask for it, review a class or add more sessions on weekends if you have a job.  

* Watch your diet. You're going to stress about the upcoming exam. Believe me junk food and bad eating habits will make it more difficult for you to focus during your exam study. Hydrate during your study. Only, snack during your break times..snack sensibly. Make the snack something that will keep you satiated for 90 minutes before your next break. 

* Oh by the way breaks should be no more than 15 minutes at a time. Not long enough for you to get distracted but enough time for a snack and bio breaks then back to it. Distractions are just small dragons!

* Keep a strict study schedule. In these last few weeks, a schedule is a must. As much as you can, realistically.  Study comes first if the exam is your goal.
